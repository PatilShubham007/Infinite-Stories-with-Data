HOW HAPPY ARE YOU?

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.
The World Happiness Report ranks cities around the world by their subjective well-being and digs more deeply into how the social, urban and natural environments combine to affect our happiness.

The plot shows happiness score of each country by region. The plot might seem to be very simple but the thing that I really enjoyed in this was the tooltip.
Tooltips add beauty to our dashboard and customising tooltip is really kind of an artform. What is your take on tooltip?
